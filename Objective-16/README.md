The objective is a browser game where the player has to target elves which move very fast over the screen.

In the browser developer console it was easy to spot, that the game uses a cookie `ElfHunt_JWT` which contains a JWT token:
`eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzcGVlZCI6LTUwMH0.`

With the help of https://token.dev it was possible to decode this JWT and it was found as an unsigned JWT with the content:
```
{
  alg: "none",
  typ: "JWT"
}.
{
  speed: -500
}.
```
As this is not signed, it can easily be modified to `speed: -40` using the above tool:
`eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzcGVlZCI6LTQwfQ`
Assigning the new JWT to the cookie, the game is much easier to play.
