# Objective 20: Space Island Door Access Speaker
**Location: Space Island: Spaceport Point**
**Hints provided by Jewel Loggins**

It is a prerequisite to have [Objective 19: Active Directory](https://github.com/joergschwarzwaelder/hhc2023/tree/main/Objective-19) already cleared.

The aim of this objective is to get familiar with voice cloning using AI.

We need the sentence from the file "InstructionsForEnteringSatelliteGroundStation.txt" from objective 19:
```
Now I shall be out of sight;
So through the valley and over the height.'
And he'll silently take his way.
```
spoken with the voice of Wombley Cube.

In order to achieve this, we use the [audio book](https://www.holidayhackchallenge.com/2023/wombleycube_the_enchanted_voyage.mp3.zip) Wombley gave us .
With this data, we can head to https://play.ht, clone Wombley's voice using the audio book and the "voice clone" feature and let this artificial voice speak the above sentence: [Audio file](https://github.com/joergschwarzwaelder/hhc2023/blob/main/Objective-20/And%20he%20whispered.wav)

This file can be played against the access controller to open the door.
