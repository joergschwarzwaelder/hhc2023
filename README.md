## A Holiday Odyssey | Featuring 6: Geese A-Lei'ing!

**Background information:**  
Again the game title is a reference to the ["Twelve days of Christmas"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_%28song%29), after "2 Turtle Doves", "3 French Hens", "4 Calling Birds", "5 Golden Rings", now "6 Geese A-laying" (likely next year "7 Swans A-swimming").  
This year the Holiday Hack Challenge moved from the cold Northpole to the Geese Islands in the Pacific Ocean.  
There are in total six islands with different ports where the player can disembark.

The player can move between the islands with a ship, which can also be used for fishing (objectives 23 and 24) and boat racing.

It turned out that Jack recruited Wombley Cube and created the AI ChatNPT. With this he made Santa and the Elves move to the Geese islands. Jack has a geostationary satellite there to intercept and manipulate all communication (on North Pole this is not possible).
