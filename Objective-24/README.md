Based on the [Objective 23](https://github.com/joergschwarzwaelder/hhc2023/tree/main/Objective-23), this objective is about catching one of each individual species living in the sea.
In the "sea" HTML code we can see a link to the [Fish Density Reference](https://2023.holidayhackchallenge.com/sea/fishdensityref.html)
```
<!-- <a href='fishdensityref.html'>[DEV ONLY] Fish Density Reference</a> -->

```
Using this information, we know that there are 171 different species out there with different habitats.
