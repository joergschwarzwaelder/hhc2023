# Objective 17: Certificate SSHenanigans
**Location: Pixel Island: Raincaster Cliffs**  
**Hints provided by Alabaster Snowball**

In this objective it shown how SSH certificates can be used for SSH authentication. For this, a [web tool](https://northpole-ssh-certs-fa.azurewebsites.net/api/create-cert?code=candy-cane-twirl) is provided which signs SSH public keys with the principal "elf". With that it is possible to login to "ssh-server-vm.santaworkshopgeeseislands.org" as user "monitor".

Sample SSH public key:
```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIKaOSLQJfY/Mm39aSP6kE6Lwc72PAdilEePpx1/d+CRq joergen@northpole
```
