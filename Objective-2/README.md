# Objective 2: Snowball Fight
**Location: Christmas Island: Frosty's Beach**  

In this game, the player has a snowball fight against Santa and some Elves.
In single player mode the player is assisted by "Elf the dwarf".

In order to summon "Elf the dwarf" as helper, the JavaScript code has to be tweaked to launch the game with the additional parameter `singlePlayer=true`. To do so, a breakpoint can be set in the browser console at the location where the game is launched.
