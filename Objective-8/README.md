# Objective 8: Faster Lock Combination
**Location: Steampunk Island: Brass Bouy Port**  

This objective is about picking a "Faster Lock" padlock with a dial using three digits between 0 and 39 (simulating a "Master Lock" padlock).

There are two ways to solve this challenge:

### Picking the classic way

### Hacking the simulation
Using the browser web developer console, there is a variable `lock_numbers` in the context `paddlelockdecode.com` revealing all three numbers. In addition, the other sticky number and guess number (from the classic way) are shown.
