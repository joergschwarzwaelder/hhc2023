### Jack in the Sky
Also in the telescope a Pod should be visible, although I was not able to spot it.
Without full game completion it is empty.

After completion, Jack is in the Pod.

### Access Speaker Phrase
The phrase for the Space Island Door Access Speaker
```
And he whispered, 'Now I shall be out of sight;
So through the valley and over the height.'
And he'll silently take his way.
```
is from "The Frost" by Hannah Flagg Gould.
